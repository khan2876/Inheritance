# Inheritance  

Create classes that represent vehicles.  MountainBike, RoadBike, Car, Helicopter, Plane, Submarine

For MountainBike you should have the following atributes:  
* int: number of passengers
* int: number of gears
* String: type of shocks
* String: type of breaks
* String: color

For RoadBike you should have the following atributes:  
* int: number of passengers
* int: number of gears
* String: type of breaks
* String: color

For Car you should have the following atributes:  
* int: number of passengers
* int: top speed
* String: color

For Helicopter you should have the following atributes:  
* int: number of passengers
* int: maximum altitude
* int: number of blades
* String: color

For Plane you should have the following atributes:  
* int: number of passengers
* int: maximum altitude
* int: number of engines
* String: color

For Submarine you should have the following atributes:  
* int: number of passengers
* int: maximum depth
* int: number of engines
* String: power source
* String: color

Each class should have a constructor that initializes each of these attributes and get methods to access this data.  
Additionally, each class should have a getType method that returns a String with the type of the vehicle.

# Demo
Create a main method that instantiates at least one of each type of vehicle.  

Store each of the different vehicles in a single ArrayList.  Show that they are all stored properly by looping through the list and printing the type of each vehicle and the number of passengers that can travel in that vehicle.  

# Formatting  
Be sure to format your code properly (1 pt)  

# Commits  
Commit at logical intervals.  Each time you create a file, finish a file, or update a file, you must commit that change.  An appropriate commit message should describe what is being saved / what has been changed.  At least 3 per day.  
Commit messages should have useful descriptions of the work done.  

# Grading  
Formatted well - 1 pt  
Regular commits - 2 pts  
Useful commit messages - 1 pt  
Working classes for 6 types of vehicles - 2 pts  
Minimal repetition of code - 3 pts  
Working demo - 2 pts  


# Submit  
All the vehicle classes, parents class(es), and demo.
